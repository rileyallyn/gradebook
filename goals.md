# Standards Based Learning (SBL) Grading System TODO

> My wife is a teacher at an elementary school where they are integrating the Standards Based Learning [SBL] approach. The problem with SBL is that the current grading software does not cater for it at the moment. So I decided to try and help make grading easier for her by designing something that she could use. As I asked around with other teachers, they voiced their interest in trying out something like that. So I thought that this would be a fun, real world, problem for you guys to "hack" away at and try your hands a designing an app for. In SBL grading scheme, unlike standard grades, each assignment is given a proficiency score from 1-4. If a student wants to strengthen their grades for a particular quiz, test, or assignment, they can take it again in order to increase their score. For this hackathon, we would like you to think about needs that teachers would have as they grade student assignments.
